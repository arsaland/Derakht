# Derakht (درخت)

A collaborative storytelling experience where humans and AI work together to craft unique narratives. Derakht (meaning "tree" in Persian) combines real-time collaboration with artificial intelligence to create immersive stories that branch and grow organically.

## Features

- 🤝 Real-time collaborative storytelling with 2-8 participants
- 🤖 AI-powered narrative enhancement using GPT-4
- 🎨 Story visualization through DALL-E 3
- 🗣️ Text-to-speech narration
- 🌐 Seamless WebSocket communication
- 📱 Responsive design across all devices
- 🇮🇷 Full Persian (Farsi) language support

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (GPT-4, DALL-E 3, TTS)
- **Build Tools**: Vite, ESLint

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/derakht.git
cd derakht
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash

```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LOCAL_IP=your_local_ip_address
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## How It Works

1. Create or join a story room
